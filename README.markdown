beta-Juliet
===========

beta-Juliet is a minimal event-oriented language which, as of version 2.0, is
probably Turing-complete.

NOTE
----

I've decided that the languages beta-Juliet and 2Iota are really too similar
to be seperate languages.  So, as of this repo, they've been merged like this:

* This language is called beta-Juliet.
* The language previously referred to as beta-Juliet, is now beta-Juliet 1.0.
* The language previously referred to as 2Iota is now beta-Juliet 2.0.
* The reference interpreter for beta-Juliet 2.0 is called `2iota`.
* The optional pre-processor for beta-Juliet 1.0 is still called Portia.

Further reorganization and stuff forthcoming.
