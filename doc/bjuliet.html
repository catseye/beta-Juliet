<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The beta-Juliet language is not Turing-Complete by itself.
Nor is the Portia pre-processor.  However, when used together, the
intent is that they form a Turing-Complete language.</p>

<h2>beta-Juliet</h2>

<p><b>beta-Juliet</b> models the world as an unordered, unorganized set of
events, such as <code>DominoFalls</code>, <code>CatMeows</code>, or
<code>SunSets</code>.</p>

<p>These events can cause, and be caused by other events.  In addition
they can do so conditionally - but the only conditional available for
checking is: <i>given two events, which one fired more recently?</i></p>

<h2>Portia</h2>

<p><b>Portia</b> is solely concerned with expanding parameterized events
into series of concrete events, for example creating events
<code>DominoOneFalls</code>, <code>DominoTwoFalls</code>, etc., from
the generalized meta-event <code>Domino(N=Domino)Falls</code> where
<code>Domino</code> is an <b>alphabet</b> over the range of dominoes.</p>

<p>Without each other, these languages are interesting but not powerful.
beta-Juliet cannot generalize, and therefore is not Turing-Complete.
Portia cannot loop unrestrictively, and
therefore is <i>also</i> not Turing-Complete.</p>

<p>[Historical note: Portia, as it has stood for many years, cannot really generalize
either, so the combination of beta-Juliet and Portia is still not Turing-Complete.]</p>
